## Scripts

### SU Packs Python Scripts

- **filter_keyword_orders.py**  
  Filters emails of users who ordered items containing a specific keyword (e.g., "case") and lists the matching items in a CSV file.
- **clean_orders_csv.py**  
  Removes duplicate customer entries from an order CSV file based on unique identifiers (email, name, phone number), saves the cleaned data into a new CSV file, and ensures that the database is updated by removing corresponding duplicate records.
